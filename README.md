# School Landing + Feedback (React)

A minimal React app with:

- Landing page styled like a typical school website (header, banner, school image).
- QR code that links to the feedback page.
- Feedback page with textarea and submit button (persistent in `localStorage`).
- Uses React Router and `react-qr-code`.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
